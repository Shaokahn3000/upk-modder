Project files

Path to project folder
Project consists of a list of modfiles, which should be in the project's modsrc/ folder.
Each modfile has it's filename and target upk (can be null) target upks can be tested against UPKFILE= and GUID= in the modfile for consistency

project-level operations :
basic project primitives:
new project -- DONE
open project -- DONE
save project - NOT NEEDED
save as project -- change to "rename project"
close project -- DONE

project composition operations:
create new modfile in project  -- handled by creating new file and saving in project modsrc directory
add existing modfile to project -- handled by creating new file and saving in project modsrc directory
remove modfile from project  -- handled by deleting / moving file in OS
open modfile in project to new tab -- DONE

modding-specific operations:
set target upk for project (will only apply to those modfiles that match)
apply/revert project
updated references for project (maybe)
